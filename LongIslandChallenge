@h1 The Long Island / Granite Mon Challenge

The Long Island Challenge is a loosely organized annual event, and that's about all I can say with any real confidence.

Well, okay, how about this:  The Long Island Challenge, more recently the GraniteMonChallenge (and even more ephemerally the GraniteDogChallenge), starts with a three-mile swim from Long Island (in BlueHillBay) to the mouth of the Harbor itself.  It was the brainchild (if you really want to call it that) of Justin Pollard and Ben Walker, who decided to swim from ... well, from Long Island to the mouth of the Harbor.  Please, someone correct me if I'm wrong. They made it, and since then, so have a lot of others.  The event has moved around a bit, and more recently has included other pieces and parts, but is completely and utterly non-competitive.  You might call it more of an outing than a challenge, but it doesn't have the same ring to it.

There's also been some talk of making the Long Island Challenge a benefit for the BlueHillHeritageTrust.  Some money went their way last year, but this hasn't yet really taken off.

@h3 The Swim Part

BlueHillBay is a nice place to swim.  Well, sorta.  We get up early and boat over and stand on the rocks and seaweed and feeling cold, and then we jump in because there's no real way out of it at that point.  Traditionally, we haven't worn WetSuits unless you call slathering your BodyInCrisco a wetsuit. But we do have ChaseBoats. 

Here's the route, more or less:

Then we climb up MountKatahdin.

@h3 Other Long Island Challenges

A quick Google search turns up *lots* of things called the Long Island Challenge.  Hundreds and hundreds of hits, actually.  There's an academic competition for high school students, a track meet, and lots of other things too.  So perhaps the Granite Mon is a better choice.

@h3 Etc.

What the heck is this MoshiMoshi thing?
