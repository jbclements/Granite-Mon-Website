Blue Hill Bay lies outside Blue Hill Harbor, and is sort of an eastern adjunct to PenobscotBay on a map of Maine.  The water is a good deal warmer there than it is out in the open ocean, but it hovers in the mid-to-lower sixties during the summer, and gets really darn cold in the winter.  A good temperature for a LongIslandChallenge is 65 or above.
