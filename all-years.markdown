# The Long Island / Granite Mon Challenge #

The Long Island Challenge is a loosely organized annual event, and that's about all I can say with any real confidence.

Well, okay, how about this: The Long Island Challenge, more recently the
GraniteMonChallenge (and even more ephemerally the GraniteDogChallenge), starts
with a three-mile swim from Long Island (in BlueHillBay) to the mouth of the
Harbor itself.  It was the brainchild (if you really want to call it that) of
Justin Pollard and Ben Walker, who decided to swim from ... well, from Long
Island to the mouth of the Harbor.  Please, someone correct me if I'm
wrong. They made it, and since then, so have a lot of others.  The event has
moved around a bit, and more recently has included other pieces and parts, but
is completely and utterly non-competitive.  You might call it more of an outing
than a challenge, but it doesn't have the same ring to it.

There's also been some talk of making the Long Island Challenge a benefit for
the BlueHillHeritageTrust.  Some money went their way last year, but this
hasn't yet really taken off.

## The Swim Part ##

BlueHillBay is a nice place to swim.  Well, sorta.  We get up early and boat
over and stand on the rocks and seaweed and feeling cold, and then we jump in
because there's no real way out of it at that point.  Traditionally, we haven't
worn WetSuits unless you call slathering your BodyInCrisco a wetsuit. But we do
have ChaseBoats.

Here's the route, more or less:

## The Bike Part

Then we bike from BlueHill to MountKatahdin.

## The Climb Part

Then we climb up MountKatahdin.

## History 

What follows is a fragmentary history of the event.  Please please please contribute your memories and your pictures. Here's the best way to AddPictures that I know of.


### 1995 : The First Time

Really, Justin or Ben could tell you more than I (JohnClements) could.  Justin
and Ben jumped in the water and swam from here to there (or more accurately,
from there to here). They stuck together, and had no support boat (IIRC), so it
was pretty much literally sink or swim.  Fortunately, neither one sank.

Actually, if memory serves and that is a big if, we had Matt Semler chasing us
but in the middle of the bay he realized that he needed gas so he left us to go
to the KYC and fuel up. (BWW)

I'm not aware of any photos from this year.

### 1996 : The Second Time

I (John Clements) recall this episode quite vividly, as it was the first one in
which I participated.  I was a last-minute addition, really.  Andy Wanning had
decided (details?) to do the same swim that Justin and Ben had, and wisely
lined up Molly and David Gutcheon and ... (?) to drive alongside him.  Well, I
heard about it at the last minute, I had just flown up the night before, and
decided (I'd been swimming a lot in a pool) to give it a go.

Alice Clements had suggested bringing crisco, on the principle that it would
protect Andy from the cold water, and both of us lathered ourselves up with it.
Then we jumped into the water.  BlueHillBay is quite cold.

We started swimming, but we didn't do as good a job as Justin & Ben at keeping
together. I think we thought the boat could easily keep track of both of us,
but as we swam farther and farther apart, it turned out to be nearly
impossible.  The lesson here is that it's very hard to see a swimmer in the
water at more than about fifty or a hundred yards, especially if the swimmer
isn't wearing a brightly colored swim cap.

To make a long story short, Andy and I grew sufficiently far apart that the
current pulled us in different directions, and we made landfall at points that
were more than two miles apart.  Fortunately, nobody died, and the day ended in
magnificent triumph!

### 1997 : The Third Time

There are actually some pictures from this go-round, so you can get some idea of what the swim looks like.  This was the first year with a bunch of people; It may have been the year that it got the LongIslandChallenge title.  Also, after the problems of the prior year, this running of the challenge featured a more organized ChaseBoats group, with one boat for each swimmer.

These pictures were all taken by Mary McHenry, and I hope she doesn't mind. (Mary?)

## Other Long Island Challenges

A quick Google search turns up *lots* of things called the Long Island Challenge.  Hundreds and hundreds of hits, actually.  There's an academic competition for high school students, a track meet, and lots of other things too.  So perhaps the Granite Mon is a better choice.
