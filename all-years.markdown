# The Long Island / Granite Mon Challenge #

The Long Island Challenge is a loosely organized annual event, and that's about all I can say with any real confidence.

Well, okay, how about this: The Long Island Challenge, more recently the
GraniteMonChallenge (and even more ephemerally the GraniteDogChallenge), starts
with a three-mile swim from Long Island (in BlueHillBay) to the mouth of the
Harbor itself.  It was the brainchild (if you really want to call it that) of
Justin Pollard and Ben Walker, who decided to swim from ... well, from Long
Island to the mouth of the Harbor.  Please, someone correct me if I'm
wrong. They made it, and since then, so have a lot of others.  The event has
moved around a bit, and more recently has included other pieces and parts, but
is completely and utterly non-competitive.  You might call it more of an outing
than a challenge, but it doesn't have the same ring to it.

There's also been some talk of making the Long Island Challenge a benefit for
the BlueHillHeritageTrust.  Some money went their way last year, but this
hasn't yet really taken off.

## The Swim Part ##

BlueHillBay is a nice place to swim.  Well, sorta.  We get up early and boat
over and stand on the rocks and seaweed and feeling cold, and then we jump in
because there's no real way out of it at that point.  Traditionally, we haven't
worn WetSuits unless you call slathering your BodyInCrisco a wetsuit. But we do
have ChaseBoats.

Here's the route, more or less:

## The Bike Part

Then we bike from BlueHill to MountKatahdin.

## The Climb Part

Then we climb up MountKatahdin.

## History 

What follows is a fragmentary history of the event.  Please please please
contribute your memories and your pictures. Here's the best way to AddPictures
that I know of.


### 1995 : The First Time

Really, Justin or Ben could tell you more than I (JohnClements) could.  Justin
and Ben jumped in the water and swam from here to there (or more accurately,
from there to here). They stuck together, and had no support boat (IIRC), so it
was pretty much literally sink or swim.  Fortunately, neither one sank.

Actually, if memory serves and that is a big if, we had Matt Semler chasing us
but in the middle of the bay he realized that he needed gas so he left us to go
to the KYC and fuel up. (BWW)

I'm not aware of any photos from this year.

### 1996 : The Second Time

I (John Clements) recall this episode quite vividly, as it was the first one in
which I participated.  I was a last-minute addition, really.  Andy Wanning had
decided (details?) to do the same swim that Justin and Ben had, and wisely
lined up Molly and David Gutcheon and ... (?) to drive alongside him.  Well, I
heard about it at the last minute, I had just flown up the night before, and
decided (I'd been swimming a lot in a pool) to give it a go.

Alice Clements had suggested bringing crisco, on the principle that it would
protect Andy from the cold water, and both of us lathered ourselves up with it.
Then we jumped into the water.  BlueHillBay is quite cold.

We started swimming, but we didn't do as good a job as Justin & Ben at keeping
together. I think we thought the boat could easily keep track of both of us,
but as we swam farther and farther apart, it turned out to be nearly
impossible.  The lesson here is that it's very hard to see a swimmer in the
water at more than about fifty or a hundred yards, especially if the swimmer
isn't wearing a brightly colored swim cap.

To make a long story short, Andy and I grew sufficiently far apart that the
current pulled us in different directions, and we made landfall at points that
were more than two miles apart.  Fortunately, nobody died, and the day ended in
magnificent triumph!

### 1997 : The Third Time

----

There are actually some pictures from this go-round, so you can get some idea of what the swim looks like.  This was the first year with a bunch of people; It may have been the year that it got the LongIslandChallenge title.  Also, after the problems of the prior year, this running of the challenge featured a more organized ChaseBoats group, with one boat for each swimmer.

These pictures were all taken by Mary McHenry, and I hope she doesn't mind. (Mary?)

### 1998 : The Fourth Time

In 1998, the Long Island Challenge happened twice, because we were badly organized and not everyone could be there at the same time.  So there's really FourthTimePartOne and FourthTimePartTwo.

#### FourthTimePartOne

Pictures? Description?  I think Ann Neuhauser participated in *both* this swim and FourthTimePartTwo.

Molly just added some pictures.

### 1999 : The Fifth Time

Pictures? Description?

### 2000 : The Sixth Time

Pictures? Description?

### 2001 : The First Granite Mon

This was the first year of the Granite Mon Challenge, including the swim, the bike ride, and the climb up MountKatahdin.  

The swim went well; details, anyone? 

The bike part went well, too, unless you hold our late start against us.  It's
pretty hard to get moving after a big swim like that.  We all met at Justin's
house after a shower, and ate a wonderful breakfast (extremely belated
*thanks!*).  Riders this year included Ben Walker, John Clements, Justin
Pollard, (anyone else?) and JuanTheRemarkable.  We started in the middle of
BlueHill, and rode northward past Penobscot, Orono, (more towns, anyone?)
.... Our route paralleled the upper PenobscotRiver, and we had many scenic
stops.  Some not-so-scenic stops, too.

In a roadside accident, JohnClements munched his back wheel, and sat out the
last ten miles or so, until everyone threw in the towel and tossed the bikes in
the back of the ChaseCars and motored up to that motel in Millinocket.

The next day, in our haste to get to Baxter State Park, we managed to get two
speeding tickets for three vehicles.  Actually, it would have been three
speeding tickets had Mark Read not signalled to us to pretend we didn't know
them.

We were fortunate to get into the park, and were assigned to the Abol
trail--quickest route up the mountain, involving a long clamber over a huge
rockslide that happened pretty recently; in the last two hundred years or so.

At the trailhead, we discovered that there was no running water in the park.
Oh dear.  Being young and dumb, we decided to chance it with the water that we
had; somewhere in the neighborhood of 3/4 of a liter per person.

We made it to the top pretty handily, and sat and enjoyed the truly spectacular
view.  Even with the park's restriction on entry, the summit was moderately
crowded, but what the hell; there's enough lonely grandeur to go around.

What's more humbling is to arrive at the summit alongside the Appalachian Trail
through-hikers, for whom this peak is the end of a very very long road.  Our
achievement seems pretty mundane in comparison.  It's strange to watch these
people leave the peak; they've suddenly turned from through-hikers back into
pedestrians.

Gee whiz, I hope someone has some pictures.

### 2002 : The Second Granite Mon

This last year: things must write about:

- participants (incl. Justin's friends from Yale)
- nice warm swim
- somewhat earlier start
- beautiful ride
- Oh My God Where's Ben
- Everyone made it the whole way
- Lots of ibuprofen
- Gorgeous climb (as usual)

### 2003 : The Third Granite Mon

![alt text](images/2003/lic-03-fisheye.jpg)

Well, the 2003 GraniteMonChallenge has come and gone. It did in fact happen on August 23, and
six intrepid swimmers showed up at 6:00 am:

@h3 The Swim

- JustinPollard
- Ben Walker
- Andy Wanning
- JohnClements
- Wing Taylor
- Ted Heyd

Most agreed that the water was as warm as it's ever been, though I (John Clements) broke down and wore a wet suit (my excuse is that I was injured in a bike wreck) so I wouldn't know.

The wind picked up a bit during the second half, and it was pretty choppy (well, relatively speaking) by the time we reached the Bectons' dock. Justin, Ben, and I made the full swim, while Andy and Ted climbed out when they got bored ... actually, that swim is pretty darn boring.  Well, when you're not freezing, anyway.  A special mention goes to Wing Taylor, who arrived on three hours sleep and managed to whip out a broad array of strokes to make it from Long Island to the mainland, which is after all the difference between living and dying, in some hypothetical sense.

This picture (and the prior one) were taken by Wing Taylor, despite his appearing in near-entirety in each one.  Hmmm.

![alt text](images/2003/lic-03-reg.jpg)

@h3 The Ride

The post-swim break was leisurely and lengthy, and at noon, there was a lively discussion about whether to bike at all.  I was out of the bike part (and the climb part) in either case, because of the aforementioned bike wreck.  The intrepid crew

- JustinPollard
- Ben Walker
- Andy Wanning

...did finally set out, and plowed northward to somewhere near H... H... er, Bangor.  This is where
I took all their bicycles away and they drove north toward East Millinocket.

Here's a picture of the three of them:

[html <img src = "images/2003/3 dogs.jpg">]

All of these pictures were taken by Abby... oh dear, I don't know her last name.  Anyone?

@h3 The Climb

Well, I wasn't there, so I really can't say much; the day was unbelievably cold, with an early-season cold front blasting Canadian air down as far as Blue Hill.  Evidently, the conditions on the mountain made it more or less un-climb-able.  Details, anyone?  Fortunately, Abby took a bunch of pictures. Here's one of Abby:

[html <img src = "images/2003/Abby.jpg">]

As I wasn't here, I can only guess at a chronological ordering on these.  Here's one labeled "lunch":

[html <img src = "images/2003/3 dogs-lunch.jpg">]

Here's one of the lads in front of the mountain:

And finally, two pictures of the atmospheric conditions that made the final ascent impossible:

### 2004 : The Fourth Granite Mon

Please, tell us anything you know about the upcoming 2004 Granite Mon Challenge.

Please?

### 2005 : The Fifth Granite Mon

### 2006 : The Sixth Granite Mon

### 2007

### 2008

I think this was the year of the gorgeous fogged-in tour of the harbor, wherein
it was deemed far too dangerous to try to make it to Long Island, much less
back again. The water was incredibly warm, though, so we settled for a swim out
to the nun, then over to Lappahanink, then to one of the inner-harbor cans, then back to the KYC.

Participants:

- Mark Read
- Ben Walker
- John Clements
- Andy Wanning (Andy, can you confirm this?)
- Justin, were you there?

### 2009

John Clements swam early and short with Erin Taylor from Jim Point across to High Head.

Later, there was a more serious swim... and climb? More research required.

### 2010 :

As I write this, the 2010 Granite Mon is still in progress.  This morning at
6:00 AM, a hardy crew of four swimmers and a nearly-as-hardy crew of
chase-boaters gathered at the KYC dock, and on a spectacularly sunny and smooth
day set out on one of the warmest swims on record.  Andy--the only one without
a wet suit--exited the water when he got too cold, but Charlotte, Justin, and
John stuck really close together for a near-simultaneous arrival at the Becton's dock.

For the rest of the story, we'll have to see how it unfolds.

Participants:

- John Clements
- Charlotte Clews
- Justin Pollard
- Andy Wanning

## Other Long Island Challenges

A quick Google search turns up *lots* of things called the Long Island Challenge.  Hundreds and hundreds of hits, actually.  There's an academic competition for high school students, a track meet, and lots of other things too.  So perhaps the Granite Mon is a better choice.
