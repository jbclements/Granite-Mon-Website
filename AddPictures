Currently, the only way to add pictures that I'm aware of is to embed references to them in an \[html ...\] escape.

To be more procedural: 

#. First, you need to get your pictures into a web location, so that they can be referenced by a URL.  For instance, I pay the nice folks at Pair.com to host my brinckerhoff.org web site, so I can put pictures on their server and then refer to them with URLs like this one: http://www.brinckerhoff.org/images/brinck-portrait.jpg .

#.  Then, you need to click on the EditThisPage link at the bottom of each MoshiMoshi page so you can add things.

#. At the place where you want the picture to appear, insert a link like this (to see what you should actually type, click on the edit this page link at the bottom of *this* page):

#. What you've added is just a link; it doesn't copy the picture from your url.  In other words, if you move the picture from the "place" that the link refers to, the link will stop working.

[html <img src="http://www.brinckerhoff.org/images/brinck-portrait.jpg">]

Okay, yes, that's a giant pain in the butt.  Wouldn't it be marvelous if you could just paste the picture into the editing window.  But right now, you can't.  

But please!  Don't let this stop you.  As a last resort, send your pictures to JohnClements and he (I) will scan them in for you.
