Really, Justin or Ben could tell you more than I (JohnClements) could.  Justin and Ben jumped in the water and swam from here to there (or more accurately, from there to here). They stuck together, and had no support boat (IIRC), so it was pretty much literally sink or swim.  Fortunately, neither one sank. 

Actually, if memory serves and that is a big if, we had Matt Semler chasing us but in the middle of the bay he realized that he needed gas so he left us to go to the KYC and fuel up. (BWW)

I'm not aware of any photos from this year.
