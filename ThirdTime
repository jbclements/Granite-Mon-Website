There are actually some pictures from this go-round, so you can get some idea of what the swim looks like.  This was the first year with a bunch of people; It may have been the year that it got the LongIslandChallenge title.  Also, after the problems of the prior year, this running of the challenge featured a more organized ChaseBoats group, with one boat for each swimmer.

These pictures were all taken by Mary McHenry, and I hope she doesn't mind. (Mary?)
