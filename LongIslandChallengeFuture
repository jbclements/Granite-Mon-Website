Well, the 2003 GraniteMonChallenge has come and gone. It did in fact happen on August 23, and
six intrepid swimmers showed up at 6:00 am:

        - JustinPollard
- Ben Walker
        Andy Wanning
        JohnClements
        Wing Taylor
        Ted Heyd

Most agreed that the water was as warm as it's ever been, though I (John Clements) broke down and wore a wet suit (my excuse is that I was injured in a bike wreck) so I wouldn't know.

The wind picked up a bit during the second half, and it was pretty choppy (well, relatively speaking) by the time we reached the Bectons' dock. Justin, Ben, and I made the full swim, while Andy and Ted climbed out when they got bored ... actually, that swim is pretty darn boring.  Well, when you're not freezing, anyway.  A special mention goes to Wing Taylor, who arrived on three hours sleep and managed to whip out a broad array of strokes to make it from Long Island to the mainland, which is after all the difference between living and dying, in some hypothetical sense.


The post-swim break was leisurely and lengthy, and at noon, there was a lively discussion about whether to bike at all.  I was out of the bike part (and the climb part) in either case, because of the aforementioned bike wreck.
