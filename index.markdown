title: The Granite Mon Challenge
---

The Long Island Challenge is a loosely organized annual event, and that's about
all I can say with any real confidence.

Well, okay, how about this: The Long Island Challenge, more recently the
Granite Mon Challenge (and even more ephemerally the Granite Dog
Challenge), starts with a three-mile swim from Long Island (in Blue Hill
Bay) to the mouth of the Harbor itself.  It was the brainchild (if you
really want to call it that) of Justin Pollard and Ben Walker, who
decided to swim from ... well, from Long Island to the mouth of the
Harbor.  Please, someone correct me if I'm wrong. They made it, and
since then, so have a lot of others.  The event has moved around a bit,
and more recently has included other pieces and parts, but is completely
and utterly non-competitive.  You might call it more of an outing than a
challenge, but that doesn't have the same ring to it.

There's also been some talk of making the Long Island Challenge a benefit for
the Blue Hill Heritage Trust.  Some money went their way last year, but this
hasn't yet really taken off.

## The Swim Part ##

Blue Hill Bay is a nice place to swim.  Well, sorta.  We get up early
and boat over and stand on the rocks and seaweed and feeling cold, and
then we jump in because there's no real way out of it at that point.
Traditionally, we haven't worn [wet suits](/wet-suit.html/) unless you call
slathering your body in Crisco a wetsuit. *(Ed.  note: in more recent
years, the clear trend is toward wet suits, and in 2010 three out of the
four swimmers wore them.)* But we do have chase boats.

Here's the route, more or less:

![Little Chart](images/little-chart.jpg)

The water is cold but not *that* cold; it usually hovers around 19 degrees
celsius, but it can vary quite a bit based on recent weather; a good solid
overnight offshore wind can bring up some really cold stuff.

Also, we make the most of tidal current.  We swim at full flood, and there
might be as much as two knots of flow.  Which, when your swim is two
nautical miles, means that as long as you can keep pulling for an hour
or two, you'll probably get there.

## The Bike Part

Then we bike from Blue Hill to Mount Katahdin. This is about 160 kilometers.

## The Climb Part

Then we climb up Mount Katahdin.

### 1995 : The First Time

Really, Justin or Ben could tell you more than I (John Clements) could.  Justin
and Ben jumped in the water and swam from here to there (or more accurately,
from there to here). They stuck together, and had no support boat (IIRC), so it
was pretty much literally sink or swim.  Fortunately, neither one sank.

Actually, if memory serves and that is a big if, we had Matt Semler chasing us
but in the middle of the bay he realized that he needed gas so he left us to go
to the KYC and fuel up. (BWW)

I'm not aware of any photos from this year.

---

### 1996 : The Second Time

I (John Clements) recall this episode quite vividly, as it was the first one in
which I participated.  I was a last-minute addition, really.  Andy Wanning had
decided (details?) to do the same swim that Justin and Ben had, and wisely
lined up Molly and David Gutcheon and ... (?) to drive alongside him.  Well, I
heard about it at the last minute, I had just flown up the night before, and
decided (I'd been swimming a lot in a pool) to give it a go.

Alice Clements had suggested bringing crisco, on the principle that it would
protect Andy from the cold water, and both of us lathered ourselves up with it.
Then we jumped into the water.  Blue Hill Bay is quite cold.

We started swimming, but we didn't do as good a job as Justin & Ben at keeping
together. I think we thought the boat could easily keep track of both of us,
but as we swam farther and farther apart, it turned out to be nearly
impossible.  The lesson here is that it's very hard to see a swimmer in the
water at more than about fifty or a hundred yards, especially if the swimmer
isn't wearing a brightly colored swim cap.

To make a long story short, Andy and I grew sufficiently far apart that the
current pulled us in different directions, and we made landfall at points that
were more than two miles apart.  Fortunately, nobody died, and the day ended in
magnificent triumph!

### 1997 : The Third Time

There are actually some pictures from this go-round, so you can get some idea
of what the swim looks like.  This was the first year with a bunch of people;
It may have been the year that it got the Long Island Challenge title.  Also,
after the problems of the prior year, this running of the challenge featured a
more organized chase boats group, with one boat for each swimmer.

These pictures were all taken by Mary McHenry, and I hope she doesn't mind.

### 1998 : The Fourth Time

In 1998, the Long Island Challenge happened twice, because we were badly
organized and not everyone could be there at the same time.

#### First Running

Pictures? Description?  I think Ann Neuhauser participated in *both* this swim
and FourthTimePartTwo.

Molly just added some pictures.

From Ben's Head, clockwise: Ben Walker, Andy Wanning, Will Becton, a guy who
hung out with us that summer, Mark Read, Sally the Yoga instructor, Alice
Clements, ?, ?(looks really familiar), ?, JP

#### Second Running

This swim included four swimmers:

- Byron (*gah!* what is his last name?)
- Ann Neuhauser
- Justin Pollard
- JohnClements

Pictures.  These were taken by Robin Clements:

### 2001 : The First Granite Mon

This was the first year of the Granite Mon Challenge, including the swim, the
bike ride, and the climb up Mount Katahdin.

The swim went well; details, anyone? 

The bike part went well, too, unless you hold our late start against us.  It's
pretty hard to get moving after a big swim like that.  We all met at Justin's
house after a shower, and ate a wonderful breakfast (extremely belated
*thanks!*).  Riders this year included Ben Walker, John Clements, Justin
Pollard, (anyone else?) and Juan The Remarkable.  We started in the middle of
Blue Hill, and rode northward past Penobscot, Orono, (more towns, anyone?)
.... Our route paralleled the upper Penobscot River, and we had many scenic
stops.  Some not-so-scenic stops, too.

In a roadside accident, John Clements munched his back wheel, and sat out the
last ten miles or so, until everyone threw in the towel and tossed the bikes in
the back of the Chase Cars and motored up to that motel in Millinocket.

The next day, in our haste to get to Baxter State Park, we managed to get two
speeding tickets for three vehicles.  Actually, it would have been three
speeding tickets had Mark Read not signalled to us to pretend we didn't know
them.

We were fortunate to get into the park, and were assigned to the Abol
trail--quickest route up the mountain, involving a long clamber over a huge
rockslide that happened pretty recently; in the last two hundred years or so.

At the trailhead, we discovered that there was no running water in the park.
Oh dear.  Being young and dumb, we decided to chance it with the water that we
had; somewhere in the neighborhood of 3/4 of a liter per person.

We made it to the top pretty handily, and sat and enjoyed the truly spectacular
view.  Even with the park's restriction on entry, the summit was moderately
crowded, but what the hell; there's enough lonely grandeur to go around.

What's more humbling is to arrive at the summit alongside the Appalachian Trail
through-hikers, for whom this peak is the end of a very very long road.  Our
achievement seems pretty mundane in comparison.  It's strange to watch these
people leave the peak; they've suddenly turned from through-hikers back into
pedestrians.

Gee whiz, I hope someone has some pictures.

### 2002 : The Second Granite Mon

This last year: things must write about:

- participants (incl. Justin's friends from Yale)
- nice warm swim
- somewhat earlier start
- beautiful ride
- Oh My God Where's Ben
- Everyone made it the whole way
- Lots of ibuprofen
- Gorgeous climb (as usual)

---

### 2003 : The Third Granite Mon

![alt text](images/2003/lic-03-fisheye.jpg)

Well, the 2003 GraniteMonChallenge has come and gone. It did in fact happen on
August 23, and six intrepid swimmers showed up at 6:00 am:

The swim:

- Justin Pollard
- Ben Walker
- Andy Wanning
- John Clements
- Wing Taylor
- Ted Heyd

Most agreed that the water was as warm as it's ever been, though I (John
Clements) broke down and wore a wet suit (my excuse is that I was injured in a
bike wreck) so I wouldn't know.

The wind picked up a bit during the second half, and it was pretty choppy
(well, relatively speaking) by the time we reached the Bectons' dock. Justin,
Ben, and I made the full swim, while Andy and Ted climbed out when they got
bored ... actually, that swim is pretty darn boring.  Well, when you're not
freezing, anyway.  A special mention goes to Wing Taylor, who arrived on three
hours sleep and managed to whip out a broad array of strokes to make it from
Long Island to the mainland, which is after all the difference between living
and dying, in some hypothetical sense.

This picture (and the prior one) were taken by Wing Taylor, despite his appearing in near-entirety in each one.  Hmmm.

![alt text](images/2003/lic-03-reg.jpg)

The ride:

The post-swim break was leisurely and lengthy, and at noon, there was a lively
discussion about whether to bike at all.  I was out of the bike part (and the
climb part) in either case, because of the aforementioned bike wreck.  The
intrepid crew

- Justin Pollard
- Ben Walker
- Andy Wanning

...did finally set out, and plowed northward to somewhere near H... H... er, Bangor.  This is where
I took all their bicycles away and they drove north toward East Millinocket.

Here's a picture of the three of them:

![alt](images/2003/3-dogs.jpg)

All of these pictures were taken by Abby... oh dear, I don't know her last name.  Anyone?

The Climb:

Well, I wasn't there, so I really can't say much; the day was unbelievably
cold, with an early-season cold front blasting Canadian air down as far as Blue
Hill.  Evidently, the conditions on the mountain made it more or less
un-climb-able.  Details, anyone?  Fortunately, Abby took a bunch of
pictures. Here's one of Abby:

![alt](images/2003/Abby.jpg)

As I wasn't here, I can only guess at a chronological ordering on these.  Here's one labeled "lunch":

![alt](images/2003/3-dogs-lunch.jpg)

Here's one of the lads in front of the mountain:

![alt](images/2003/3-dogs-mtn.jpg)

And finally, two pictures of the atmospheric conditions that made the final ascent impossible:

Andy writes:

Essentially, it was mostly a wash, primarily because of the 70% chance of
thunderstorms we heard about for Katahdin after finishing the swim.  We
realized that with those odds, as JP put it "this would create a 99% chance
that the park rangers wouldn't allow us up Katahdin tomorrow".  So that
would've been a lot of effort (and expense, a la hotel & food) for naught.

Then it was also raining sporadically as we sat around JP's pondering what to
do next, and after the swim, which I will explain below, we were pretty beat of
course and not exactly psyched to ride bikes in the rain.  However, we were
still sort of psyched to bike around the peninsula.  At the same time, Hillary
was going to go hiking in Acadia and was encouraging us to come with her
instead, so this was the other option.  Unfortunately for the bike option, one
of Oliver's bikes, the one I was going to ride, had a hole in the inner tube -
so he patched that one, and found another hole, so he patched that one, and
found another hole, and so on, and after 4 holes it was getting late and that
basically broke the ol' camel's back.  So it was off to hiking in Acadia.


Which was actually quite nice of course - we hiked around Jordan Pond, up a
mountain in the fog, and back down and around to the Jordan Pond restaurant,
forget the name, and had a really nice meal there.  So that all worked out
pretty well.


But of course I digress.  The swim was, in two words, f\*cking freezing.  I
would have given my left nut (and very nearly did to frostbite) to have that
nifty little wetsuit of yours.  Just getting out of the boat at Long Island and
picking around the rocks & seaweed while applying generous amounts of Crisco
was pretty miserable, though fun in a we're-totally-nuts kind of way.  And
wading into the water was more or less hellacious, and then diving in the water
was ridiculous, especially the freezing-the-face part.  I thought eventually my
face would numb up like the rest of my body, but it never really did, so I
would just do a few crawl strokes and then do the side- and backstrokes and try
to keep my face out of the water.  And that was after I had summoned over Sara
to give me the can of Crisco so I could re-apply the stuff on my face.


So I lasted maybe half an hour, as did Justin, as the other skinny guy.  I got
into Sara’s boat, and my teeth started chattering a few minutes later, and
didn’t stop until we got to the Becton’s dock another hour or whatever later.
So, just in case you were wondering, we were F\*CKING COLD.  When we caught up
to Oliver, who was churning along at about 2 knots I suppose and leading the
pack of 2, he yelled to us “how much further ‘til the dock?”, and after we told
him, he added “My goodness it’s cold”.

So he finally dragged his numb body onto the dock and sat there shivering for a
while, but was very pleased of course to have actually finished.  Maybe 15 or
20 minutes later, Ben calmly ascended the ladder, and when asked about the
temperature, said “Actually I got used to it pretty fast”, not kidding a
smidgeon.  This provided much mirth and shocking disbelief for our band of
swimming, well, supporters, which at this point consisted of Nate, Hillary,
Howie, Vicki, Cuzco the dog, and Hillary’s dog as well as the aforementioned
Sara and JP and me.

So we called it a job well done and proceeded to our respective showers, and
then onto JP’s house for an absolutely delectable brunch consisting of
scrambled eggs, toast with pesto spread, blueberries, and some other stuff
which I can’t remember.  Abby and The Judge joined us at JP's, the latter
positing the whacky idea of initiating a bike ride that mere mortals might
actually be interested in, such as biking around the peninsula and then hiking
up Blue Hill, making it a peninsula event that area people & businesses might
like to join and/or sponsor.  It was also suggested that we start a non-profit
associated with the event called “Bibles for Guantanamo” and donate any
proceeds to a fund of that purpose in order to show our compassion for the
prisoners being abused in our name there.  However, some may not exactly see
the sarcastic nature of such an endeavor, so it may be shelved in favor of a
more broadly inclusive goal such as “Weed for the Fatigued” or something like
that (actually this just popped into my head, so should not be considered an
official proposal of any sort).  No, actually there were a few more
suggestions, but I don’t remember them, so we’ll need some help remembering or
fresh inspiration if we are to come up with a theme for any fundraiser we may
want to endeavor next year.


Anyway, then we proceeded to the 3-hour council meeting in the driveway, an
experience perhaps more painful than diving into the Blue Hill Bay water, and
you know the rest.

For '07, we had a successful swim in the rain.  Swimmers: me (Andy Wanning),
Mark Read, Oliver Grantham, JP, Ben Walker, I think Jerry.
Chaseboaters/others: Oliver's wife, his friend Sean or something, Sean(?)'s
wife, and David who made the brunch.  I'm not sure if the others did the bike
ride, because Lena & I stayed in BH and then saw mom's play, and then arrived
in Medway at 1:30 am, got 2 hours of sleep, and then climbed Katahdin with
everyone.  So yeah, successful Katahdin climb too that year.

### 2008

I think this was the year of the gorgeous fogged-in tour of the harbor, wherein
it was deemed far too dangerous to try to make it to Long Island, much less
back again. The water was incredibly warm, though, so we settled for a swim out
to the nun, then over to Lappahanink, then to one of the inner-harbor cans, then back to the KYC.

Participants:

- Mark Read
- Ben Walker
- John Clements
- Andy Wanning (Andy, can you confirm this?)
- Justin, were you there?

Andy Writes:

For '08, yes I was there, but I was just a chaseboater, along with Lena
(Kulikova) and Mark's friend Will Etundi.  There was no other biking/climbing
that time, 'cuz it was Matt's wedding day.  JP might have done that stuff later
on in the year though.

---

### 2009

John Clements swam early and short with Erin Taylor from Jim Point across to High Head.

Later, there was a more serious swim... and climb? More research required.

---

### 2010 :

As I write this, the 2010 Granite Mon is still in progress.  This morning at
6:00 AM, a hardy crew of four swimmers and a nearly-as-hardy crew of
chase-boaters gathered at the KYC dock, and on a spectacularly sunny and smooth
day set out on one of the warmest swims on record.  Andy--the only one without
a wet suit--exited the water when he got too cold, but Charlotte, Justin, and
John stuck really close together for a near-simultaneous arrival at the Becton's dock.

For the rest of the story, we'll have to see how it unfolds.

Participants:

- John Clements
- Charlotte Clews
- Justin Pollard
- Andy Wanning

---

### 2011 :

In 2011, Charlotte Clews organized either the Maine Mountain challenge or the Granite Mon
challenge or the Long Island challenge or whatever the heck we're going to call it. It
was a resounding success, as evidenced by this picture that I have to ask for permission
to post.

The swimmers:

- Louise Bourne
- Charlotte Clews
- Mary Clews
- Moira Mahon
- Kim Parrot
- Bahia Yackzan

## Other Long Island Challenges

A quick Google search turns up *lots* of things called the Long Island
Challenge.  Hundreds and hundreds of hits, actually.  There's an academic
competition for high school students, a track meet, and lots of other things
too.  So perhaps the Granite Mon is a better choice.
