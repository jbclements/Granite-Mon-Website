The Granite Mon Challenge is a more recent name for the expanded LongIslandChallenge.  In 2001, Justin came up with the idea of combining the swim with a bike ride and a climb of MountKatahdin.  The idea is that you actually ride from Blue Hill to MountKatahdin, and this actually happened in the SecondGraniteMon.
