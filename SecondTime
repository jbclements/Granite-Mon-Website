I (JohnClements) recall this episode quite vividly, as it was the first one in which I participated.  I was a last-minute addition, really.  Andy Wanning had decided (details?) to do the same swim that Justin and Ben had, and wisely lined up Molly and David Gutcheon and ... (?) to drive alongside him.  Well, I heard about it at the last minute, I had just flown up the night before, and decided (I'd been swimming a lot in a pool) to give it a go.

Alice Clements had suggested bringing crisco, on the principle that it would protect Andy from the cold water, and both of us lathered ourselves up with it.  Then we jumped into the water.  BlueHillBay is quite cold.

We started swimming, but we didn't do as good a job as Justin & Ben at keeping together. I think we thought the boat could easily keep track of both of us, but as we swam farther and farther apart, it turned out to be nearly impossible.  The lesson here is that it's very hard to see a swimmer in the water at more than about fifty or a hundred yards, especially if the swimmer isn't wearing a brightly colored swim cap.  

To make a long story short, Andy and I grew sufficiently far apart that the current pulled us in different directions, and we made landfall at points that were more than two miles apart.  Fortunately, nobody died, and the day ended in magnificent triumph!
