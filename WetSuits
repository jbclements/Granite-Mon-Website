Wouldn't it be nicer to do an open-water swim in a wet suit?  Well, yes.  I think the resistance to wet suits comes principally from some sort of machismo.  On the other hand, BlueHillBay is really cold, and there's a fine line between machismo and masochism.  (In fact, the only difference is an 'S' and a bit of anagramming.)  Wet suits are also said to increase buoyancy pretty significantly, so that could make the swim even easier.  Bart Hayes got his foot in the door by starting the swim in 2002 with a wet suit, but he took it off halfway (unless I'm mistaken?).

The future is cloudy.

2003: well, the future isn't cloudy any more: I (John Clements) wore a wet suit this year (ostensibly to cover a leg wound & some stitches), and *man*, is there a difference.  I was warm and buoyant.  It really did seem like a bit of a cheat.
