SmushedTogether words are two capitalized words smushed together.  In particular, my possibly incorrect understanding is that a SmushedTogether word must be ...

Okay, I *was* incorrect.  It looks like I can express it as the following regexp:

\[A-Z\]+\[^A-Z\]+\[A-Z\]+\[^A-Z\]+

To see if I'm correct, see which of the following come out as links:

- AaAa
- AaA
- AAA
- AAAA
- AA
- AAaA
- AAaAa
- 12
- Aaa1
- AaaA1
- AaaAaa1
- A1A1
