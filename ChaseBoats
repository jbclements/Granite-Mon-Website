Chase boats are a crucial part of the LongIslandChallenge, and it's probably fair to say that some of us wouldn't be here today if we hadn't had the chase boats to pull us out.  *Yay, Chase boats!*

Chase boats come in many forms.  In fact, a dinghy is pretty much ideal: quiet, about the right speed, no two-stroke oil in the water, less chance of killing a swimmer, a bit of exercise for the pilot, but overall pretty relaxing.  The only problem with dinghies is that it would take a really long time to row them all over to LongIsland.  Hence, the motor boat.

It's good to have a few motor boats.  They help tow all the dinghies over, and they hold everyone's clothes, and they're nice and fast in case anyone is turning blue.

So again, a *giant* thanks to all of the chase boat pilots, most notably Molly Wanning and Robin Clements. Other wonderful chase boat drivers include (in alphabetical order):

- Sarah Becton
- Samantha Coit
- Ann Neuhauser
- Steve Neuhauser
- Mary McHenry
- Hannah Semler
- Matthew Semler

- Susannah Taylor
